# ExpertSystem

Overview
Students are assessed every year in the beginning of  Fall semester to determine their reading levels for their current grade level.  My interviewee is a Paraeducator for reading at Davis Korematsu Elementary, who assist teachers and other school aides with many tasks, but she mainly help students to read at or above their grade levels. To do this, she assessed students on their reading with variety of assessments such as Rigby or Benchmark. The assessment allows reading paras to understand where each student is at in their reading journey. Later, they work  individually or in groups with students to help them improve or excel above their reading levels.
